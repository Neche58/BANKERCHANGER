## System Overview

BANKERCHANGER is a full-stack decentralized application consisting of four main layers:

| Layer | Technology | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| **Smart Contracts** | Rust / Soroban SDK | On-chain market logic, treasury, factory |
| **Indexer** | TypeScript | Polls Soroban events, persists to database |
| **Backend API** | Express / TypeScript | REST API, auth, caching, WebSocket feed |
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14 / React | User interface, wallet integration |

Supporting services include PostgreSQL (primary data store), Redis (caching and rate limiting), and Prometheus (metrics).

## Component Breakdown

### Smart Contracts (Soroban)

| Contract | Responsibility |
|----------|---------------|
| **shared** | Common types, error codes, AMM math, event helpers |
| **market_factory** | Creates markets, manages oracle whitelist, emergency pause |
| **market** | Individual market logic — bet placement, claims, refunds |
| **treasury** | Fund custody, withdrawal limits, payout distribution |

**Security features:** Reentrancy guards (CLAIMING flag), emergency pause, oracle whitelist enforcement, 2-of-3 oracle consensus.

### Indexer

The indexer runs as a standalone TypeScript process that:

1. Polls the Soroban RPC endpoint every 5 seconds via `getEvents()`.
2. Filters events by contract ID and topic.
3. Parses `scVal` event payloads.
4. Upserts event data into PostgreSQL.
5. Maintains a cursor (`indexer_checkpoints` table) for crash recovery.

### Backend API

Express.js application providing:

- **REST API** — Markets, bets, claims, admin, auth, oracle endpoints.
- **Authentication** — JWT with session version tracking, 2FA/TOTP support.
- **Rate Limiting** — Redis-backed, per-route IP and user-based limits.
- **Caching** — Redis with 30-second TTLs and pattern-based invalidation.
- **WebSocket** — Real-time activity feed for live market updates.
- **Cron Jobs** — Auto-resolution, auto-lock, session/token cleanup.
- **Metrics** — Prometheus counters and histograms on `/metrics`.

### Frontend

Next.js 14 App Router application with:

- **State management** — Zustand stores.
- **Data fetching** — TanStack React Query.
- **Wallet integration** — Stellar SDK for transaction signing.
- **Styling** — Tailwind CSS.

## Data Flow: Contract Event to Frontend

This diagram shows how an on-chain event propagates through the system to the end user.

## Oracle Resolution Flow

### Oracle Consensus Mechanism

Oracles are whitelisted Stellar accounts that submit match outcome reports to the backend. The system uses a **2-of-3 consensus model** to prevent any single oracle from unilaterally resolving a market.

#### How Consensus Works

1. **Report Submission**: After a boxing match concludes, each whitelisted oracle independently fetches the official result and submits a signed report via `POST /api/oracle/report`. The report includes the market ID, declared outcome (`fighter_a`, `fighter_b`, or `draw`), and a cryptographic signature.

2. **Report Storage**: Each report is stored in the `oracle_reports` table with the oracle's public key, reported outcome, signature, and timestamp. Reports are immutable once stored.

3. **Consensus Check**: After storing each new report, the backend queries all reports for that market. If **2 out of 3** whitelisted oracles have submitted reports with the **same outcome**, consensus is reached.

4. **On-Chain Resolution**: Once consensus is achieved, the backend invokes the `resolve()` method on the market's Soroban contract. The contract:
   - Validates the resolver is the factory contract (authorized caller)
   - Sets the market outcome to the consensus value
   - Unlocks the claim function for winning bettors
   - Emits a `MarketResolved` event

5. **Late Reports**: If a third oracle submits a report after resolution, the report is still stored for audit purposes but does not trigger any further action.

6. **No Consensus**: If oracles submit conflicting reports (e.g., 1 for `fighter_a`, 1 for `fighter_b`, 1 for `draw`), the market remains in `locked` status. An automated retry mechanism (`autoResolution.cron.ts`) will re-attempt resolution periodically, giving oracles time to converge.

#### Consensus Flow Diagram

```mermaid

    participant O1 as Oracle 1
    participant O2 as Oracle 2
    participant O3 as Oracle 3
    participant API as Backend API
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant MC as Market Contract

    Note over O1,O3: Boxing match concludes

    O1->>API: POST /api/oracle/report (outcome: fighter_a, sig: σ₁)
    API->>API: Verify oracle is whitelisted
    API->>API: Verify signature against oracle's public key
    API->>DB: INSERT oracle_report (oracle=O1, outcome=fighter_a)
    API->>DB: SELECT reports WHERE market_id = M
    DB-->>API: [{O1: fighter_a}]
    Note over API: 1/3 reports — no consensus yet
    API-->>O1: 200 OK { consensusReached: false }

    O2->>API: POST /api/oracle/report (outcome: fighter_a, sig: σ₂)
    API->>API: Verify oracle is whitelisted
    API->>API: Verify signature
    API->>DB: INSERT oracle_report (oracle=O2, outcome=fighter_a)
    API->>DB: SELECT reports WHERE market_id = M
    DB-->>API: [{O1: fighter_a}, {O2: fighter_a}]
    Note over API: 2/3 agree on fighter_a — CONSENSUS REACHED

    API->>MC: invoke resolve(market_id, fighter_a)
    MC->>MC: Validate authorized caller
    MC->>MC: Set market.outcome = fighter_a
    MC->>MC: Unlock claims for winning side
    MC->>MC: Emit MarketResolved event
    MC-->>API: Transaction confirmed

    API->>DB: UPDATE market SET status='resolved', outcome='fighter_a'
    API->>API: Broadcast via WebSocket
    API-->>O2: 200 OK { consensusReached: true, txHash: "..." }

    opt Late report (after resolution)
        O3->>API: POST /api/oracle/report (outcome: fighter_a, sig: σ₃)
        API->>DB: INSERT oracle_report (already resolved)
        API-->>O3: 200 OK { alreadyResolved: true }
    end
```

#### Oracle Security Model

| Property | Implementation |
|----------|---------------|
| **Identity** | Each oracle is identified by a whitelisted Stellar public key |
| **Authentication** | Reports must carry a valid Ed25519 signature verifiable against the oracle's key |
| **Authorization** | Only the oracle's registered public key can submit reports on its behalf |
| **Sybil resistance** | Oracles must be whitelisted by the market factory admin |
| **Collusion resistance** | 2-of-3 threshold means no single oracle can unilaterally resolve a market |
| **Non-repudiation** | Signed reports are stored immutably for audit |
| **Liveness** | Auto-resolution cron re-attempts resolution if oracles fail to converge initially |

### Original Oracle Resolution Sequence

Oracles are whitelisted accounts that submit match outcome reports. Resolution requires 2-of-3 consensus.

    Note over O1,O3: Boxing match concludes

    O1->>API: POST /api/oracle/report (outcome: fighter_a)
    API->>DB: Store oracle_report
    API-->>O1: 200 OK

    O2->>API: POST /api/oracle/report (outcome: fighter_a)
    API->>DB: Store oracle_report
    API->>DB: Check consensus (2 of 3 agree)

    Note over API: Consensus reached (2/3)

    API->>MC: invoke resolve(market_id, outcome)
    MC->>MC: Set market outcome, unlock claims
    MC-->>API: Resolution tx confirmed

    API->>DB: Update market status = resolved
    API->>API: Broadcast via WebSocket

    Note over O3: Oracle 3 report is accepted but not required
    O3->>API: POST /api/oracle/report (outcome: fighter_a)
    API->>DB: Store oracle_report (already resolved)
```
